I have taken a Dataset from Google and applied logistic Regression on the set in ordet to get a a total number of yes and no by using confussion matrix
Basically Confussion matrix tells u the total number of (predicted yes,actual yes) and (predicted no,actual no)
At the end we have divided the left diagonal with the sum of both left and right diagonal in order to get the accuracy.
